# Desert Forge: full-stack e-commerece website

This is a CodeCademy curriculum portfolio project, the purpose is to create a database using SQL with data of our choice, followed by an API using JS on express and finally a client side must also be created using react and redux. The project aims to provide the exprience of a small scale e-com website that sells medieval weaponery. The greatest challenge that was encoutered in this project by far was creating a temporary cart that would carry over with its items to the account of the user.
